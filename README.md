# ETL-project

For this ETL project, weâ€™ve used the trending youtube video statistics dataset from kaggle that provide daily statistics for the top trending videos on Youtube. The data was used to determine the top trending videos on the platform during the pandemic period. 

The potential use of the data is to identify  

- The categories of videos Canadians prefer to watch during the pandemic
- The factors that affect the popularity of certain videos
- Advertisement strategies that could be utilized by Youtube to promote material and generate revenues
- Provide insights to video makers on what type of videos to make during this period
